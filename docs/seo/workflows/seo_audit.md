# SEO Audit Workflow

## Objective
Produce a complete local SEO audit for a home service business. Identify technical issues, keyword gaps, on-page problems, competitor ranking advantages, and a prioritized action plan to improve organic search visibility and lead volume. This is the entry point for the full SEO system — all downstream modules (Site Structure, Content Engine, GBP, Game Plan) depend on the keyword clusters and findings produced here.

## Prerequisites
- Client record must exist in the system (overview, services, competitors loaded)
- ICP document must be completed first — the audit uses ICP audience data to prioritize keywords by buyer intent

## Inputs
- `target_service` *(optional)* — The primary service to audit (e.g. "Roof Replacement", "HVAC Installation"). If not provided, derive the primary service from the client's services.md.
- `target_location` *(optional)* — The geographic target (e.g. "Denver, CO"). If not provided, derive the primary city/region from the client's overview.md. Never guess — use only what is explicitly stated in the client context.

## Output Format
The final deliverable is a professional SEO audit report written for a business owner — not an SEO technical team.

- **Do NOT include Phase 0, 1, 2, or 3 headers in the output.** These are internal research steps. The deliverable starts at Phase 4 (Synthesis) and is presented as a clean report.
- **Do NOT include pre-flight confirmation checklists** or process status lines (e.g. "✅ Client website URL confirmed"). Handle that work silently.
- **Define technical terms in plain language** the first time they appear. Example: "schema markup (code that tells Google what type of business you are and what services you offer)" — not just "schema markup." Same for: NAP (Name, Address, Phone), GBP (Google Business Profile), E-E-A-T, canonical tags, robots.txt, etc.
- **Executive Summary:** Write as 3–4 readable paragraphs. Not fragmented bullets.
- **Tables are good** for technical checklists, competitor comparisons, and keyword clusters — keep those.
- **Write as if handing this directly to the client.** Clear, confident, specific. If something is a critical problem, say so plainly.

## Optional Inputs
- `website_url` — Pre-filled from client record if available
- `gbp_url` — Client's Google Business Profile URL (pre-filled from client record if available)
- `audit_scope` — Limit the audit: `full` (default) | `technical_only` | `keywords_only` | `competitors_only`
- `competitor_count` — How many competitors to analyze: `2` | `3` (default) | `5`

## Tools Available
- `firecrawl-scrape` — Scrape the client's website pages for on-page SEO analysis
- `firecrawl-search` — Search Google for competitor rankings and keyword opportunities
- `firecrawl-crawl` — Crawl the full website to identify missing pages, thin content, and structural gaps
- `firecrawl-map` — Discover all indexed pages on the client's domain

---

## Phase 0: Pre-Flight Check

Before starting, verify silently (do not output this checklist — handle it internally):
1. Client website URL is set in the system
2. At least one competitor is listed
3. ICP document exists — if missing, stop and tell the user to run **Build ICP** first
4. If `target_service` was not provided, identify the primary service from services.md
5. If `target_location` was not provided, derive the primary city/region from overview.md
6. If `audit_scope` is set to anything other than `full`, skip the phases that don't apply and note which phases were skipped in the Executive Summary

If any critical data is missing, state exactly what's needed and stop. Otherwise begin Phase 1 immediately — no pre-flight confirmation output.

---

## Phase 1: Website Audit

### 1.1 Crawl the Client Website
Use `firecrawl-crawl` on the client's website URL.

Capture:
- Total pages indexed
- Page titles and meta descriptions (are they set? are they keyword-optimized?)
- H1 and H2 headings on service pages
- Internal linking structure (are service pages linked from the homepage?)
- Page speed indicators (if available)
- Missing pages (e.g. no dedicated page for `target_service` in `target_location`)

### 1.2 Analyze the Service Page for `target_service`
Use `firecrawl-scrape` on the specific service page.

Evaluate:
- Is there a dedicated page for this service? If not, flag as a critical gap.
- Does the page title include the primary keyword (`target_service + target_location`)?
- Does the page include trust signals: reviews, credentials, guarantees?
- Is there a clear CTA (call, form, booking)?
- Word count — is it competitive (600+ words for local SEO)?

### 1.3 Technical SEO Signals
Using the crawl output from 1.1, check for:

- **HTTPS** — Is the site served over HTTPS? HTTP = Critical issue.
- **robots.txt** — Does `/robots.txt` exist and is it not blocking crawlers?
- **XML Sitemap** — Does `/sitemap.xml` exist? Is it linked from robots.txt?
- **Canonical Tags** — Are canonical tags present on crawled pages? Any self-referencing issues?
- **404s and Redirects** — Any broken internal links or redirect chains (301→301→301)?
- **Mobile Viewport** — Is the viewport meta tag present?
- **Schema Markup** — Is `LocalBusiness`, `Service`, or any structured data detectable in the HTML? Note the schema types found.

### 1.4 Local SEO On-Page Signals
- **NAP Consistency** — Is the Name, Address, Phone consistent across all pages (header, footer, contact page)?
- **City/Region Mentions** — Does page copy mention the target city and service area naturally?
- **Location Pages** — Does the site have dedicated location/city pages, or is it a single-area site?
- **GBP Link** — Is the Google Business Profile linked from the website (footer or contact page)?
- **Geo-Tagged Images** — Any evidence of geo-tagged or locally relevant images?

### 1.5 Authority Signals
- **Homepage Internal Links** — Does the homepage link directly to key service pages?
- **Trust Signals** — Are there visible trust elements: reviews widget, star ratings, certifications, guarantees, badges?
- **E-E-A-T Indicators** — Does the site have: an About page, team page or bio section, author attribution, years in business mentioned?
- **Orphaned Pages** — Any pages with zero internal links pointing to them?

---

## Phase 2: Keyword Research

### 2.0 Keyword Ranking Status Check

**Run this before all other keyword research.** Check whether the client currently ranks for their most important keywords so we know what's working, what needs boosting, and what's a full gap.

**If `clients/{slug}/gsc_data.md` exists:** Read it and use actual GSC positions as ground truth. Skip the proxy searches below for any keyword where GSC data is available.

**If no GSC data:** Use `firecrawl-search` as a proxy:
- For each candidate primary keyword (at minimum: `[target_service] [target_location]`, `[target_service] near me`, `best [target_service] [target_location]`):
  1. Search `site:[client_domain] [keyword]` — if client pages appear → **Ranking**
  2. Search `[keyword]` — if client appears but not in top 10 → **Weak** (positions 11–30)
  3. No client result found → **Gap**

**Classification tiers:**
- ✅ **Ranking** — Client page appears in top 10 results for this keyword
- ⚠️ **Weak** — Client page exists and ranks, but positions 11–30 (page 2+)
- ❌ **Gap** — No client page ranking for this keyword

Add the following table to the Phase 4 output under **Keyword Ranking Status**:

```
| Keyword | Status | Client Page | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------------|-------|
| [keyword] | ✅ Ranking | /services/heat-pump | Pos ~5 |
| [keyword] | ⚠️ Weak | /services/mini-splits | Pos ~18, page not optimized |
| [keyword] | ❌ Gap | None found | No dedicated page exists |
```

Note at the bottom: "GSC data used: yes/no" — this flags the data quality for the reader.

### 2.1 Identify Primary Keywords
Use `firecrawl-search` to find:
- Top-ranking pages for `[target_service] [target_location]`
- Related queries: "best", "near me", "cost of", "how much does", "[service] company [location]"

### 2.2 Long-Tail and Question Keywords
Use `firecrawl-search` to find:
- Cost/price queries: "how much does `[target_service]` cost in `[target_location]`", "`[target_service]` price `[target_location]`"
- Comparison queries: "`[target_service]` vs `[alternative]`", "should I `[action]` or `[alternative]`"
- Qualifier queries: "best `[target_service]` company near me", "licensed `[target_service]` contractor `[target_location]`", "affordable `[target_service]` `[target_location]`"
- Seasonal/emergency modifiers: "emergency `[target_service]`", "`[target_service]` same day", "`[target_service]` in winter/summer"

### 2.3 Local Expansion Keywords
- Identify 5–10 surrounding cities/neighborhoods within the service area (use the client's `overview.md` service area if listed, otherwise infer from the target location)
- Search `[target_service] [surrounding_city]` for each to confirm search demand exists
- Search what city+service keyword combinations the top competitors rank for (use `site:[competitor_domain]` + city name combinations)
- Document the full list of `[service] + [city]` pairs to target with location pages

### 2.4 Content Opportunity Keywords
Use `firecrawl-search` to identify informational queries:
- "how to `[related action]`", "what is `[related term]`", "signs you need `[target_service]`"
- "how long does `[target_service]` take", "is `[target_service]` worth it", "what happens during `[target_service]`"
- "DIY vs professional `[target_service]`", "how to choose a `[target_service]` company"
These become blog/content targets. Note each keyword and its search intent.

### 2.5 Keyword Clustering
Group all keywords discovered in Phases 2.1–2.4 into three buckets. This output is consumed directly by `seo_site_structure.md` and `seo_content_engine.md`.

**Bucket A — Service Page Targets**
| Keyword | Search Intent | Priority |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| (high-intent buying keywords — "service + location", "best service company", "licensed contractor") | Commercial | Critical/High/Medium |

**Bucket B — Location Page Targets**
| Keyword | City | Priority |
|---------|------|----------|
| (city+service combinations for each surrounding area) | | |

**Bucket C — Blog/Informational Targets**
| Keyword | Search Intent | Internal Link Target |
|---------|--------------|---------------------|
| (how-to, what-is, signs-you-need queries) | Informational | (which service page this should feed) |

Minimum: 5 keywords per bucket. Flag if any bucket is under 5 and explain why.

### 2.6 Competitor Keyword Gaps
For each known competitor:
- Search `site:[competitor_domain]` to see their indexed pages
- Search `[competitor_name] [target_service]` to see where they rank
- Note which keywords they rank for that the client does not

### 2.7 Local Pack Analysis
Search `[target_service] near me` and `[target_service] [target_location]`:
- Who appears in the Google Local Pack (top 3 map results)?
- Does the client appear? If not, identify why (review volume, category mismatch, distance)
- How many reviews do Local Pack leaders have vs. the client?
- **GBP Existence Check** — Does the client have a GBP at all? If `gbp_url` was provided, confirm it resolves. If not, flag as Critical.
- **Category Alignment** — What primary category do Local Pack leaders use? Does the client's category match?

---

## Phase 3: Competitor Comparison

For each known competitor (up to `competitor_count`), scrape their primary service page for `target_service`.

Compare:
- Page structure and content depth
- Keyword usage in title, H1, body
- Trust signals (reviews, years in business, certifications)
- CTAs and conversion elements

### 3.1 Schema Markup Detection
For each competitor page scraped: check for JSON-LD in the page source. Note which schema types are present (LocalBusiness, Service, FAQPage, Review, AggregateRating). Flag if competitors have schema and the client does not.

### 3.2 Backlink Proxy
For each competitor: run `site:[competitor_domain]` to get total indexed pages as a rough authority proxy. More indexed pages generally correlates with higher authority.

### 3.3 Content Velocity
- Does the competitor have a blog or resource section?
- When was the most recent post published?
- Estimated post frequency (multiple recent posts = active content program)
- Note: an active blog signals topical authority investment

Build a comparison table: Client vs. each competitor across all dimensions.

| Signal | Client | Competitor 1 | Competitor 2 |
|--------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Page title includes keyword | | | |
| H1 includes keyword | | | |
| Word count (est.) | | | |
| Trust signals | | | |
| CTA present | | | |
| Schema markup | | | |
| Schema types | | | |
| Total indexed pages | | | |
| Active blog | | | |

## Phase 4: Synthesis — The SEO Audit Report

Produce the full audit in this structure:

### Executive Summary
Write this as 3–4 readable paragraphs — not bullets. Tell the story of where this business stands in search today, what the biggest gaps are, and what will move the needle fastest. A business owner who has never heard of SEO should understand this section immediately. Avoid jargon; if a technical term must appear, define it inline.

After the paragraphs, include:
- **Top 3 Opportunities** (numbered list — specific, actionable)
- **Top 3 Risks** (numbered list — what happens if these aren't addressed)
- **Run next:** which downstream modules to run and in what order

### Technical SEO Checklist
| Signal | Status | Priority | Notes |
|--------|--------|----------|-------|
| HTTPS | ✅/❌ | Critical/High/Medium | |
| robots.txt | ✅/❌ | | |
| XML Sitemap | ✅/❌ | | |
| Canonical Tags | ✅/❌ | | |
| No 404s | ✅/❌ | | |
| Mobile Viewport | ✅/❌ | | |
| LocalBusiness Schema | ✅/❌ | | |
| Service Schema | ✅/❌ | | |
| NAP Consistency | ✅/❌ | | |
| GBP Linked on Site | ✅/❌ | | |
| Trust Signals Visible | ✅/❌ | | |
| GBP Exists | ✅/❌ | | |

### On-Page Audit
| Page | Issue | Priority | Recommended Fix |
|------|-------|----------|-----------------|

Rate each issue: **Critical** / **High** / **Medium** / **Low**

### Keyword Research Output
This section is consumed by `seo_site_structure.md` and `seo_content_engine.md`. Reproduce the full clustered keyword table from Phase 2.5 here.

**Bucket A — Service Page Targets** (reproduce full table)
**Bucket B — Location Page Targets** (reproduce full table)
**Bucket C — Blog/Informational Targets** (reproduce full table)

### Keyword Ranking Status
Reproduce the full table from Phase 2.0 here (Ranking / Weak / Gap tiers). Include the "GSC data used: yes/no" note.

### Keyword Gap Analysis
List keywords the client is not ranking for (❌ Gap tier from above), ordered by estimated search volume and buyer intent.

### Local Pack Status
- Is the client in the top 3? Why or why not?
- GBP existence and category alignment
- Review count vs. Local Pack leaders
- What would move them into the Local Pack?

### Competitor Advantages
What are the top 1–2 competitors doing that is working? What can be directly replicated?

### 90-Day Action Plan
Numbered list, ordered by impact. Each action should be:
- Specific and executable
- Assigned a difficulty: Easy / Medium / Hard
- Tied to a measurable outcome
- Labeled with which downstream module handles it: **(→ Technical fix)** | **(→ Site Structure)** | **(→ GBP)** | **(→ Content Engine)**

### AI Builder Change Brief

*This section is for clients whose websites are built with an AI website builder (e.g. Anti Gravity, Framer AI, Wix ADI). Paste the instructions directly into the builder as a change request.*

Produce the top 5 highest-impact, lowest-effort changes — formatted as direct, paste-ready instructions. Pull from the On-Page Audit and 90-Day Action Plan. Prioritize changes that:
- Require no new pages (text edits on existing pages)
- Fix Critical or High priority issues first
- Take less than 2 hours each

Format each change as:

```markdown
## AI Builder Change Brief
*Copy and paste each change below directly into your website builder as a change request.*

**Change 1 — [Short title]**
[Page URL or section]: [Exact current text or state]
→ Change to: [Exact replacement text or instruction]
Why: [One sentence on the SEO impact]

**Change 2 — ...**
```

If a required change involves creating a new page (not just editing existing content), flag it separately:

```
**🆕 New Page Required — [Page Name]**
URL: /[recommended-slug]
Target keyword: [keyword]
Content needed: [1-2 sentence brief on what this page should contain]
Note: This requires creating a new page in your builder, not just editing existing content.
```

Minimum: 5 changes total (mix of edits and new page flags as applicable).

## Output Format
Save the completed audit as a `workflow_output` of type `seo_audit`.

The report should be delivered as clean markdown that can be copied directly into a Google Doc or shared with the client.

**Important:** The Keyword Research Output section (Phase 4) must be present in full — it is the data contract between this workflow and the downstream SEO modules. Do not summarize or truncate it.
